1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now for the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The user has reported the bug, and Dora has confirmed it is valid.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It got assigned to Erol, but Erol now already has fixed the bug.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So, we're currently in a resolved state.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What has not happened yes is that somebody else has verified the fix,,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
and what also has not happened yet is that the fix actually shipped to the user--

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
for instance, by releasing a new product.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Therefore, the correct answer is resolved.
