1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The answer to that question is yes. It correlates.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The more experience, the higher the bug density.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This may come as a surprise to you, but here is the story behind it.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We mined the Eclipse bug database and check for the experience and contributions

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
of the individual developers.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It turned out that the Eclipse project lead, Eric Gamma,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
had the second highest defect density in his code across all the developers.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now, Eric Gamma is anything but a nobody.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He gave the world unit tests.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He gave the world design patterns.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And he gave the world the Eclipse programming environment,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
always with a team of course, but still.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Why would his bug density be the second highest across all Eclipse developers?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The reason is simple.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Suppose this is you. You have been assigned to fix a bug.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You look at the problem and you find, oh, this is terribly hard.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What you do is you delegate the problem to your boss,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
who is way more experienced than you,

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Now your boss is looking at the code and says,

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
"Ahhhhh...this is something I can't handle."

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He delegates this to his lead, and this guy says,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
"Ah, this looks really, really, really hard.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Only one person in the world can do that."

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is Eric Gamma, the team leader, who has no one else to delegate to.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Being that the team leader, he gets the toughest problems--

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
that is, those problems where the changes of screwing up are highest.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Still, he is the man, because anybody else dealing with these problem

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
would, on average, make a worse job than Eric Gamma.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is how the more experienced people get the tougher tasks,

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
possibly introduce more defects, but still overall they are precisely

31
00:02:15,000 --> 99:59:59,000
the right persons to do the job.
