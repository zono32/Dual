1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
With an automatic test, and this is the main advantage,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
you can always check whether the problem persists by running the automated test.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
An open automated test by definition reproduces the problem.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
If the test fails, yes, you can start debugging right away.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And in the run you can query as much information as needed,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
because you can always reproduce it.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, all four apply.
