1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Let's go and find this out--we simply enter the bug number

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
in the search field and get bug number 915.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
So, when was it reported?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is one of the oldest bugs in Mozilla, and at this time in 2012

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
it still hasn't been fixed.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That is after almost 14 years.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Still this bug has quite some history.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hundreds and hundreds of people--

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, let's make that dozens and dozens of people

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
have made hundreds and hundreds of comments over time.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This seems like a tough bug to fix.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, the correct answer here is 1998.
