1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We have a user who reports that his drawing program

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
cannot open a document saved by a previous version.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
He attaches the document in question to his bug report.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Here is developer Dora.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
She can confirm that the failure actually occurs

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and that the bug report is a real bug report.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here is developer Erol.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
He fixes the bug and can now properly process the document.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is the stage of the bug report at this point?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is it assigned?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is it resolved?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Is it verified?

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Or is it closed?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Check the correct answer.
