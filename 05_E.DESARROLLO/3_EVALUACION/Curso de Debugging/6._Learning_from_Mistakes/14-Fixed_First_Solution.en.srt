1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
As stated before, the priority defines how soon a bug will be fixed.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Of course, it may be desirable if severe bugs were fixed first,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
but a severe bug may affect only a single user.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hundreds of other users may suffer for minor issues,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which therefore may have to be addressed first.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The same goes for bugs which have been around for the longest.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Again, these may not be important for many users.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Those which are the easiest to fix.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, if a problem is easy to fix

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that certainly increases the chance to get fixed soon.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Then again, these problems may not be important.
