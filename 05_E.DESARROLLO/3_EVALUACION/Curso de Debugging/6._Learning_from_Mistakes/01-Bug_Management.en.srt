00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to the debugging course.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the past units we have discussed how to reproduce bugs,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
how to track their origins, how to simplify them,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and how to find the defect that causes a failure.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today we will consider the management side of bugs.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
There is how to track bugs,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
how to organize the debugging process,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
how to make sure that bugs don't reappear,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and how to find for a project where and why bugs occur.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And again, this scans with a dose of automation.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So we look and build tools that help us automate these things.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,000
But first a little story from the trenches.
