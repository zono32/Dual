1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The one fact that allows to infer most, if not all other facts,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is the problem history.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
First of all the problem history is crucial to reproduce the bug.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we repeat the steps, then we will hopefully find the same behavior

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
in contrast to the expected behavior.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We may also be able to summarize what's going on

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and possibly even observe the state at the moment the failure occurred,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
getting more information such as a core dump

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
or the currently active functions.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, the problem history of all these facts is the most crucial

11
00:00:38,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and the most important in a bug report.
