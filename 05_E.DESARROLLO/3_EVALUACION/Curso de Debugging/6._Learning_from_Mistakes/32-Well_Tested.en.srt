1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Next hypothesis--tests.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You can measure how well-tested individual parts of your product are.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If a piece of code has a high testing coverage,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
this means that it would be well-tested.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The question is is code that is well-tested less buggy?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Pick your choice.
