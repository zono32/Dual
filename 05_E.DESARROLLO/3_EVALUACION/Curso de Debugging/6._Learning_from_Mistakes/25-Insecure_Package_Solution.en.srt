1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The is JavaScript.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Down here you see more than a dozen classes

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that all have had plenty of security issues.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is the correct answer.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
One may wonder why is it that issues end up in a small number of places

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
and that such large parts of the code remain without any issues.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
For JavaScript this is pretty clear.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This piece holds the JavaScript interpreter,

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
which interacts through many, many interfaces with the system.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
All of these are possible attack vectors.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's no surprise that JavaScript holds these many security issues.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Plus an interpreter is notoriously hard to get right.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
HTML layout may come as a surprise.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
After all, this is just the rearranging of appropriate user interface elements on the screen.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why would there be security issues related to that?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The reason is cross-site scripting.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
As soon as you layout multiple sources on one page,

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
it may be that one sources tries to access elements of the other source,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
using your screen as a tunnel.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
These issues are right here within HTML layout.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The document object model also allows accessing and manipulating individual elements.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This again is an open door for security issues

23
00:01:37,000 --> 99:59:59,000
as well as for content base. I don't really know.
