1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So, when you are managing a successful product,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
you will get many of these bug reports,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and you must make sure that no bug report ever gets lost

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and also that all these bug reports eventually get handled in finite time.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Before that you'll have to store these problem reports somewhere

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that you can classify them, mark them, and evaluate them.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is the talk of a problem database.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Simply speaking, a problem database holds all problems

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that ever occurred with some product.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Whenever somebody reports a problem,

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
either though an automatic means or as a regular user,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
all of these problems get stored in the problem database.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You may wonder how many of these bug reports

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
end up with large companies over time.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Actually, these problem databases are huge.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't know how this is for Apple,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but I've been the first non-Microsoft researcher ever to peek into

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
the problem database of Microsoft.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can't tell you exact number of bug reports that are in there,

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
but if you consider that Microsoft has sold 450 million

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
of Windows 7 licenses.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If every user just experiences one such crash per month,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
that's more than 37 million bug reports each year.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is only from people who actually click on the send button.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I guess there's a number of people who run Microsoft

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
but don't have a proper licence and prefer not to tell Microsoft

27
00:01:42,000 --> 99:59:59,000
about their problems.
