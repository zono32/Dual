1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In most problem databases, however,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
it is real people who enter and classify problem reports.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's take a look at a real problem database

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
to get an idea what these look like.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Fortunately, for many open source projects

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
there are problem databases, which are readily available.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
For instance, let's take a look at Bugzilla,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the bug database for all Mozilla products,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
in particular the Firefox browser.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This problem database contains more than 700,000 problems.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Of course, most of them have been fixed at this point.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's assume I have a problem with a blinking cursor.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I enter the search terms for the bug, click on quick search,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and here I see all the issues that occur currently,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
or at least that have been reported by users,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
with respect to the text cursor and blinking.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
For instance, here we have blinking cursor does not move

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
when space is entered.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We can get details on this bug.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is the original bug report filed ten years ago.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's go for a more recent one.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Here's add key bindings to CSS value adjustment.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You see the bug report--you see the product it applies to,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
in this case Firefox.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You see when it was reported.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Here's the original bug report, and now you see

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the developers talking about the problem.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can also follow back the history as developers suggest patches

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
for the bug.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In the end, they discuss possible alternatives

31
00:01:40,000 --> 99:59:59,000
on how to address that bug.
