00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now for the answer. I already gave you a couple of hints.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Doesn't work on Sunday. Doesn't work on Monday. Doesn't work on Tuesday either.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
However, what happens on a Wednesday?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You see the word Wednesday doesn't really fit into this day-of-week area.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What we get here is a simple bugger overflow,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
so the okay variable gets overwritten with Y,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which actually is the accept value that the program needs in this variable in order to work.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We have the curious situation of a program that works only on Wednesdays.
