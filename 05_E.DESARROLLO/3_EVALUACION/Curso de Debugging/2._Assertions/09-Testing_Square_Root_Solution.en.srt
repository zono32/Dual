Thank you very much for your answer. Proof of the pudding is in the eating.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So what we do is we simply press run and we press run again and we see--

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we get an assertion error and indeed it is the post condition of square root that has failed.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So the correct answer is the reduction square root post condition fails.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we saw that the post condition of square root mainly squaring the square root

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
equals the origin of value failed.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is weird because all we use--we invoke the standard square root function of Python.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Does this mean that Python square root function is wrong and now finally,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
through systematic random testing, we found the bug.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Let me show you what's actually going on in here.
