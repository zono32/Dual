00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Here's the answer--what we need to do additionally in checkRep is we need to check

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
whether every single element of the zip code is between 0 and 9,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
so we set up loop that iterates over the elements and check this for every single element of the string.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We could also come up with a regular expression that ensures

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
that we have a sequence of five digits between 0 and 9.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I will leave that for the more advanced among you.
