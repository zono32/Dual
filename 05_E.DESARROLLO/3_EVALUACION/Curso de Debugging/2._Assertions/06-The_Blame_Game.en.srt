00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Assertion also easily allowed you to put the blame on specific places.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Assume I have a function f with a pre and a post condition,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and we call f and this precondition of f is satisfied.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, f calls g and now, the precondition over here is violated and raises an exception.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Quiz question, who is at fault here? Is it f because it violates the precondition of g?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is it g because it raises an exception? Or is it both f and g because they are incompatible?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Over to you.
