00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Buffer overflows are also the topic of one of my most favorite box story

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
which was reported by Isenstadt in '97.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He once had a system that would work only under very specific circumstances,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The crucial parts of memory in this story are two variables,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
one is the day of the week and the other one is a variable which we will simply call ok.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Ok can take a value which is either yes or no.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
By default in this story, ok would be set to no.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
However, ok has to be set to yes in order to work.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, the day of the week in this eight character array would be something say like Monday,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and on Monday, the program would not work.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It also would not work on Sunday.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It wouldn't work on Tuesdays either but there would be one day of the week

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and only on this day of the week where the program would work just fine.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,000
What is this day over to you.
