00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome back. We have the problem that we can't pass floating point parameters up here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And these were done later, result in errors while printing, so what we want to do is

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we want to convert them automatically into integers.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
How do we do that--well, we simply go along and use the Python function int,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
which automatically creates an integer out of the object that's being passed in here,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and in order to make everything real perfect, we also do so in the assertions.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And this is the answer to the quiz.
