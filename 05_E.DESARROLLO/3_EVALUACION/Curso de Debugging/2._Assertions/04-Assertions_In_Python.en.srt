00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome back. What's the answer to this? Well, very simple--we go and try this out.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Here's a failing assertion--2+2=5. Let's see, when we run this whole thing what we got?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So here's the antitracebacl. We get the assertion error. We get the assertion that failed.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
At least we get the line and the code, which is the same.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We get the location--line 1 malfunction and we get the list of callers.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So we've seen the list of callers, the location of the assertion of the program,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the failing assertion itself.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What we do not get is the location of the defect in the code because the defect would actually

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
causes the infection that later causes the assertion to fail may be in a completely different location.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's the whole point of debugging, trying to find the defect that causes an assertion to fail.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
However, during this course, you will find techniques that help you a lot in finding out

12
00:00:55,000 --> 99:59:59,000
where the defect is that causes an assertion to fail and all of these automatically.
