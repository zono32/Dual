00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You may have heard the story of Ariane 5 rocket which famously exploded on its first flight

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
due to software bug sometimes called the most expensive software bug in history.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you know why the Ariane 5 exploded?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It exploded simply because it had a bug in a 64-bit integer to 16-bit integer conversion.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The interesting thing though is that normally

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the code actually did have plenty of checks to track such illegal conversion.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
These checks were disabled in the Ariane 5 for reasons of performance.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Picture what would have happened if the computer in the Ariane 5

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
had been just so slightly be more performant to cover this particular check of a 64-bit

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
to a 16-bit integer then the assertion would have triggered even during the launch,

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but the Ariane 5 actually does have a very good recovery mechanisms for failing assertions.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It would have recovered, may be the flight could have done well

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and we would have escaped the most expensive software bug in history.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 99:59:59,000
$317,000,000 went into the sky because of a missing assertion.
