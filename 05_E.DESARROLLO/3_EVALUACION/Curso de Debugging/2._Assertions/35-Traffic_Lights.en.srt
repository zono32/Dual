1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
With all of these considerations, let's imagine we're working on a traffic light system.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have three colors in here, red, amber, and green.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Now, we have a little piece of code in here,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
which impacted the traffic based on the traffic light.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's assume this is part of some traffic stimulation.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So, if the light is red, then the traffic should stop.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If the light is amber, then the traffic should prepare to stop.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And if the light is green, then the traffic should go.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now, being good programmers, we always assume that something goes wrong

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
if the light is neither red nor amber nor green,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
which in principle shouldn't happen, which due to some bug could happen.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What should be here where the question mark is? I'll give you four choices.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
First, we print out "This can't happen," on the console

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
in the hope that somebody will eventually see it.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Second, we raise an assertion exception.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We knew that the program will immediately abort.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Third, we write down assert false thereby clearly documenting that this is not expected.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Last option, you write down pass, which is a Python statement, which does nothing at all.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
After all, this bug in the traffic light may well eventually go away

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
at the next cycle when we actually go back into some defined state.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Which of these four is the best option to go down here

22
00:01:20,000 --> 99:59:59,000
considering the pros and cons about assertion that we see over to you.
