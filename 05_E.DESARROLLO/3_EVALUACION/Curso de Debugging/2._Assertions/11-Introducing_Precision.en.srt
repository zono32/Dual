00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
How are we going to address this?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're going to introduce a parameter--the epsilon, which tells us the maximum deviation

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
from the current result as an absolute number and we're going to give it a default value--

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
say up to seven digits after the comma is still fine.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Now up to take this example and set up a suitable post condition in here,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 99:59:59,000
such that the difference between yÂ² and x is never greater than eps.
