1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now, all of these are fine and works well.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
There's no bug in here, but there's nothing in there which prevents misuse of my class.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For instance, nothing prevents me from entering numbers in here which make no sense at all.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
For instance, I could enter -1 as the hour or -2 as the minutes or -3 as the seconds.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This is not a valid time where we would have to come up with

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
entirely new definition of what the valid time is.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Whether we can still instantiate such an object and even printed out comes as -1, -2, -3.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So here we're still talking three numbers, but since Python does not provide static checking of types--

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
that is checking of types when the program is being compiled or have been executed.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's noting that prevents me from passing objects which have a completely different type.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So I could passed the string in here for instance and then hours would be initialized with the string--

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
this means that I would get a time object in here, which is entirely invalid.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So my situation is--I'm passing some string here in the hours attribute.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And now for a quiz, so if I do this, do I get an error when initializing the time object

15
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,000
or when printing the time object or never.
