00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The correct answer is f because it violates the precondition of g.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Pre- and post conditions are generally considered specifications--

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
that is they have the authority to say what is right and what is wrong,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
and if you violate a precondition, this means that the caller is wrong.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
G raises an exception well and that's just the messenger. We don't shoot messenger.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And f and g, well, obviously are incompatible--yes, that's right,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but since pre- and post conditions serve as specifications are definitely f is at fault

8
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,000
for violating this specification and g is fine--it just raise the exception.
