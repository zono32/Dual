00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Okay. Now for the answer. When does Eiffel check its invariants.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, it does precisely so as we defined before and as we recommended to check the invariants

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that is at the beginning of each public method and at the end of each public method.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you look at whenever some attribute is read or written, this also happens

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
within the methods of the class and in particular--say you first try to some attribute,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
then some other attribute, then some other attribute.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In between, you may have some inconsistency that will be discovered by the invariant.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So while some method of the class is operating including reading and writing attributes,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,000
we don't want to check the invariant which is why these two must not be checked.
