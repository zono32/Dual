00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Thank you for your hard work. Let's check these inputs one by one.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The first one, well this is just tags and no quotes--always has worked.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The second one--well, the second one will have the quote stripped from the input,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
but this will not be caught by the assertion because the assertion only checks

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
for the presence of HTML tags and these will be removed.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The third one, however, will not have the HTML tags removed, so this is the correct answer.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And the last one has single quotes and single quotes actually were as they should be.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We can verify this within our programming environment. We can add a simple test here.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is the input which should cause the assertion to fail, press and run,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and as you can see down here, the assertion actually failed.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I leave it to you to try out the other three inputs.
