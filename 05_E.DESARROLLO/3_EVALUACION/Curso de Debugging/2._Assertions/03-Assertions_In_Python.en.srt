1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now, compare the level of diagnostic output we've seen in C and C++

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with the amount of diagnostic output you get in Python.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If you write assert 2+2=5 as condition that evaluates the form.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So which information does one get from a failing Python assertion.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Do you get the failing assertion condition. In our case, 2+2=5.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The location of the assertion in the program. In our case, line 1.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 99:59:59,000
The location of the defect in the code or the list of callers. Try it out for yourself, over to you.
