1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So now here we have the correct assertion.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We take the square of the square root compared with x

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
and that absolute difference should be smaller than eps.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We go and tick on run and if everything works well, our test should passed by now.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
See, prints done, which means that all assertions actually now have been satisfied.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Just for the record, on my machine at this point, I can go and run a million test like this per second,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
which means that assertions can be a really great test device,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
compared that to the time it would take you to write a million number of test cases,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which means that once you do have assertions, you can go and run test like crazy.
