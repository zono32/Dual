00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We're going to the seventh and last unit in our debugging course.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this unit, we're going to do two things--first, we're going to recap the material of the other units

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and we make sure they all fit well together, and second, we're going to explore a few options

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
on what to do to avoid debugging altogether.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Plus, we're going to have a collection of the best bug stories. Enjoy!
