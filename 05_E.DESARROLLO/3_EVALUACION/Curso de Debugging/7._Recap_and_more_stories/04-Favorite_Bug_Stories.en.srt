00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,330
Some of my very favorite bug stories of all time are related to the F-16 fighter plane.

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:11,950
It turns out that when the F-16 was conceived,

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,680
it had a very interesting feature.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:23,020
Whenever it would fly and fly and cross the Equator,

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:28,550
the plane would instantly flip on its backside and keep on flying.

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,600
This, fortunately, only happened in simulation.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,170
But imagine what would have happened in real life.

8
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,420
Well, the F-16 can actually fly on its back for hours and hours.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,130
It turns out that this was a signage bug in the navigation system.

10
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,300
Picture what would have happened if this navigation system

11
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,870
had been used for commercial airlines.

12
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,910
If you see the Fasten Seat Belt sign, yes, be sure to keep your seat belt on at all times.

13
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,500
Another nice bug story is related to Google's Android operating system for mobile phones.

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:15,190
One of the first versions of Android had a diagnostic mode turned on

15
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:22,180
where an engineer would be able to use the serial port to enter arbitrary UNIX commands.

16
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:28,850
Interestingly enough, if the phone would not detect a device on the serial port,

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,320
it would fall back to the built-in keyboard instead.

18
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,320
What this meant was that anything you entered on the keyboard

19
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,760
was also interpreted as a UNIX command.

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,470
This was discovered when somebody got an SMS asking him, "What did you do all day?"

21
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,170
and he answered, "Reboot."

22
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:57,100
And lo and behold, with this command the phone rebooted.

23
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,950
Picture this: Anything you say is interpreted as a UNIX command.

24
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:06,880
He could also have said, "Remove files," or "Drop database," or whatever.

25
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,050
This was very, very quickly fixed.

26
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,220
Here's another really mysterious bug.

27
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,740
I had a program and the program crashed.

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,770
So far, so good.

29
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,300
So I inserted a print statement in order to figure out what was going on.

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,320
To my big amazement, after I inserted the print statement, the bug was gone.

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,440
Classical Heisenberg.

32
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,810
What was even better, I removed the print statement again

33
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,140
and the bug still was gone.

34
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,000
Now, that's an interesting way to fix bugs.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,980
What was going on there?

36
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,760
It turned out this was a problem in the linker.

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,650
The linker had 2 modes.

38
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,760
It had an incremental mode in which you would simply link in changes,

39
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,370
and it had a non-incremental mode where it would start linking from scratch.

40
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,370
And if I made a small change to the program, it would go into the incremental mode.

41
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,270
In the incremental mode the bug was not triggered.

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:18,320
So this is why in the first attempt, in the non-incremental mode, the bug came to be

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,500
and later, in the incremental mode, the bug was turned off again.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,380
But this was hard to work around.

45
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,570
Essentially, what I did was I made a comment in the build script

46
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:38,200
that would trigger the incremental mode by simply linking twice.

47
00:03:38,200 --> 99:59:59,000
And this is how we worked around the bug.
