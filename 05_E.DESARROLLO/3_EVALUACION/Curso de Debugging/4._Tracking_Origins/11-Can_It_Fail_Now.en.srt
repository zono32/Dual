1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, it seemed that this condition can only hold when c was in double quote.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
So first c was in double quote and then c was in less than sign.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
From all of this information, we can reconstruct the input

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that was passed over to remove HTML markup.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It must have been something along the lines of first a double quote and then an opening tag.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Between these two events, c being a double quote and c being an opening tag,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
there could also have been other characters before.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But in our deduction, none of these matter.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
For us, it is sufficient to know that indeed there is an input,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which can cause this assertion to fail.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And second, while we are doing the reasoning, we actually also stumbled

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
across the condition that was wrong here.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
From the line of our reasoning, we can now deduce that

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
if this condition had not been true, then for this input the assertion would not have failed.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
By adding appropriate parenthesis here, we can make sure that this input will not cause

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the assertion to fail and thereby through deduction we have found a fix

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
without executing the program even once.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And now for a really tough quiz in which you can show how good your deduction skills are.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If I have applied this fix with this parenthesis, can this assertion ever fail? If yes, provide an example.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If no, write down the individual steps of your deduction

21
00:01:22,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and let's see whether this is elementary, my dear Watson.
