1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We have assumed that tag was false all along, which looking at the intention of this condition

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
means that this condition never ever should have turned out to be true anyway.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
With the eyes of Sherlock Holmes, however, we would immediately deduce that this condition

4
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,000
can only hold when the first clause is true--that is c was a double quote.
