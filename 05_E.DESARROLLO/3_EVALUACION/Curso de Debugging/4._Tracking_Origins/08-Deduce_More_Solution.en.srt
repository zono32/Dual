1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And now for the answer--c was a less than sign.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This part of the condition is true, but this line was not executed. Instead this line was executed.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And therefore, this whole condition must have been false.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Since it was false, quote must have been true because that's the value

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which turns the entire condition to false.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This is the correct answer.
