1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The for statement up here, indeed, controls whether this entire block is executed or not.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Therefore, it also controls whether B is executed or not.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If this condition holds, then tag is set to true.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If it does not hold, execution resumes for the remaining conditions.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And therefore, this if condition also controls whether this is executed.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Same thing happens for the other condition.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The last condition, however, only controls whether the character

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
will be edited out or not.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It has no influence on whether code is being set or not.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Therefore, this statement does not influence whether B is executed or not.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 99:59:59,000
B is not control dependent on it.
