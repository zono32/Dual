1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well first and foremost, this is a defect

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
because if a statement produces an infection

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
then it must be erroneous itself, and an error in the code

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
is what we normally call a defect.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Since a defect in this situation implies that we can actually fix it

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
such that the infection goes away, it is also a cause,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
because it causes the infection in question.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The term infection, however, only applies to program states.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Therefore, it is no applicable in here.
