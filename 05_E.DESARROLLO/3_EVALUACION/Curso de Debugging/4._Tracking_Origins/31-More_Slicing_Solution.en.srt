1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Again, the dynamic trace gives us the answer.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We have the variable quote, which is read over here and last set up here.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
So this becomes part of the dynamic slice.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Likewise, we have quote which is read up here, for instance,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and set up here.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This also becomes part of the dynamic slice.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
However, these two lines, tag being set to true and tag being set to false,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
are never executed and therefore the values they set into tag--

9
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,000
therefore, these two statements do not become part of the dynamic slice.
