00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here again is a remove html markup program.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here's the input which normally passes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If I click on run, what I get is just a single quote.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That is, the opening tag was probably stripped,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and of course, the assertion didn't fire.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I am now setting up a trace function,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
which specifically monitors for the moment.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The loop head here in line 8 is hit for the second time.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's when I'm setting the quote variable to true

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
as found in the failing run.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So the question is whether by setting the quote variable

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
to the value found in the in the failing run at this moment,

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we can already turn the previously passing run into failing run.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We figure this out by clicking on run.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
As you can see, simply by setting the quote variable to true,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
we now have triggered the assertion.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What this means is that simply setting the quote variable to true

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
is sufficient to make the passing run now fail.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,000
We thus have identified quote as a cause for the failure.
