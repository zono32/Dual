00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So a very simple way--not really efficient, but it works--

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
is to open the file, read all the lines which then come in an array indexed by 0,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and then we simply take the line number minus 1.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the array, the lines start with 0;

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
however, in our trace the lines start with number 1.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And since the lines already contain the required new-line character,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we put in a comma at the end to suppress the second new-line character

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that would otherwise be issued by the print statement.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's try this out.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We run the whole thing, and now with every line

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the file name should be opened, line should be read,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and the one, single executed line should be printed.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We run the whole thing, and this is what we get.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You see the first tag is false, being executed,

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
then quote is false, being executed,

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
out being set to the empty string is being executed,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and here now you can see the entire program

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
one by one as it produces the output.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 99:59:59,000
And this is then what makes the actual trace of the program.
