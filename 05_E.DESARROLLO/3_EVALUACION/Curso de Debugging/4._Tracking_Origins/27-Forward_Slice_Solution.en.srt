1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
That was fairly easy.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What we need to check is simply statements that read the out variable up here,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which is down here: out=out+c and the final assertion.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We can now check whether anything else depends on

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
the execution of these statements.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The only one that's in the loop is here: out=out+c,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but none of the other statements up here ret something from out.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So if you want to know how this setting affects things downstream,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
the forward slice will tell you, "Well, it can only affect these 3 lines down here."

10
00:00:34,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Anything else in between will not be affected by the value of out.
