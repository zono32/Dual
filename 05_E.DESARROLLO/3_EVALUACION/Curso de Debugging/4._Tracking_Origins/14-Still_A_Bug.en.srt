00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Still, what automated tools can find and what humans can find, is only correct

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
with regard to the specification.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And at this point, we do not have a complete specification on what a remove

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
html markup should really do.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One of my PhD students sent me this input.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Here is the html markup, and here is the actual text.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If we feed this into the program, what is the output?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What is the result of the remove html markup function when we give it this string?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Over to you.
