00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Welcome back to our course on debugging.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today's topic is tracking origins,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
meaning how to start with a failure

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and track back origins of the failure until you find the defect that causes it.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But before we get there, a bit of a story.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
you may recall this famous scene in "A Scandal in Bohemia."

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Here we have Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes sitting by the fireplace.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They haven't seen each other for some time,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and Sherlock remarks that Watson has put on 7-1/2 pounds since they last met.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And Watson says, "How do you know?"

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And Sherlock answers, "I see. I deduce it."

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Not only does Sherlock find out that Watson has put on 7 pounds,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
he also remarks that Watson has been getting very wet lately

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and that his servant girl is clumsy and careless.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Again, Watson asks, "How on earth did you find that out?"

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
"Oh, it is simplicity itself," Sherlock says.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What Holmes sees is that on the inside of Dr. Watson's shoe

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
there is a small number of scratches,

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
which he can see in the firelight.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He deduces that these scratches have been applied by somebody

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
who very carelessly tried to clean the shoe,

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
possibly Dr. Watson's servant.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And since the shoe had to be cleaned with such a rough device,

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
this likely came from mud through which Dr. Watson had to run

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
while getting very wet.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is how Sherlock Holmes, from a single observation,

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
can deduce all the events that led to this observation.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I should add that, faced with this explanation,

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Dr. Watson exclaims, "When, Sherlock, I hear you give your reasons,

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
that I could easily do it myself.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Though, at each successive instance of your reasoning,

34
00:02:04,000 --> 99:59:59,000
I am baffled until you explain your process."
