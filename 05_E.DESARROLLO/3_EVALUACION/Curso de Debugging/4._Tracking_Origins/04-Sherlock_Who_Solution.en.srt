1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And now for the answer.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, of course, there is no real answer to that quiz.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Any answer is fine in here.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
However, a few comments on the individual options.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes in solving puzzles and all,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
this unit is right for you--as is debugging, for that matter.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you think that Sherlock Holmes is outdated,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
well, try and read one of the old stories and see how outdated they really are

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
or check out one of the most recent adaptations of Sherlock Holmes.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you find Sherlock Holmes annoying

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
because his way of reasoning is obnoxious

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
or showing off his super-smartness,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
that's probably correct, but I think that Arthur Conan Doyle

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
actually wanted to portray Sherlock Holmes as somebody who's not entirely likable.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Finally, Sherlock Who?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Here's something to discover for you. Enjoy.
