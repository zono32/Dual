1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We have 2 ways of finding this out.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We can either run the whole thing with this input

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
or we can also go through it and figure out what's going on.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The interesting thing about this input

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
is that it mixes double quotes and single quotes.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am going to use the green color

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
for section where tag mode on,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and I'm going to use the pink color

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
for sections where quote is on.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So initially, we are in tag mode.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It starts precisely here, and it goes up to the place where we find the quote.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
While we are processing the quote, quote mode is also turned on.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But now we see the second quote in here, and quote mode ends.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We are still in tag mode.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Now we see another quote, you see where the problem is.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We don't discriminate between double and single quotes,

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and therefore, a string that starts with a

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
double quote can also end in a single quote.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
See, here again we are in tag mode,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
but now we also start quote mode.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And now as we are at the greater than sign that is the end of the tag,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we are still in quote mode,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and therefore, tag mode does not end.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And sense we stay in quote mode until the very end,

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
all of this is considered to be part of the tag,

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and therefore, the answer is the result is the empty string.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This is the correct result.
