00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When there are backward slices, there are also forward slices.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A forward slice contains all statements that depend on a specific statement.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
As an example, let's come up with a forward slice

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
of the initialization of the out variable.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Very obviously, the final return statement is part of the forward slice

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
because it reads from a variable which is set over here, namely, out;

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
therefore, it is data-dependent on this earlier statement.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And, therefore, it's part of the forward slice.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now for the quiz:

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Which other statements are contained in the forward slice of S?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Check all that apply.
