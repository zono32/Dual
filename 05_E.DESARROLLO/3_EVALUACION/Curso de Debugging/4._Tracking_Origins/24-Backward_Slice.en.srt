1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If you keep on following data dependencies and control dependencies

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
starting from a given statement,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
the set of statements that you get,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
that is, the set of statements that could have possibly influenced the statement in question,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
is also called a program slice, also called backward slice

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
starting from statement, contains all of the statements

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
that the statement S in question would transitively depend upon.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You obtain a backward slice by starting with a statement S,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and then following all the dependencies until you have reached a fixed point.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The interesting thing about slices is

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that anything that is not in the slice cannot have influenced the stage at the statement S

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
or whether S is being executed  or not.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Therefore, the slice can act as a filter.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let me illustrate this by an example.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
As an example, let's take a look at the statement, "tag is true".

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is our statement S.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now, let's see what's all contained in the slice of tag.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
First of all, there is no direct data dependency because no variable is being read in here.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
However, this is control dependent on this F condition.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This if condition, again, is dependent on the character C, so this is also part of the backward slice,

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and this condition up here reads from the variable S, which is passed as a parameter up here,

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
so this is also part of the backward slice.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Now let's go to quote.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Where does quote come from?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It is being initialized up here and set down here,

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
so we end up in the place where quote is being set.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now, can you keep on doing this?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Completing the backward slice of S?

29
00:01:44,000 --> 99:59:59,000
One by one, check all statements that are part of the backward slice.
