00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you look again at our earlier steps in the deduction process,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
you will find that each of these steps precisely follows

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
either the data dependency or a control dependency.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let me use red to show data dependencies

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and green to show control dependencies.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We start with the failing assertion.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here, out has a less than character in there.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Where does out come from?

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We can follow it back, using the data dependency, to this statement.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We can also follow it back to the earlier statement,

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but that is not so much of interest,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
because here, out is just empty,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and with an empty string, this assertion would not have fired.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
By following back the control dependency, we find the tag was false.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is step 2 in the deduction process.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And we also know that C in here was a less than character,

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and since this up here controlled whether the addition to out was executed or not,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
we also get a control dependency up here.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This statement was not executed,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and this condition controlled it.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Therefore, we can deduce that quote was true.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is step 3 in here.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So we now find the place where quote was set.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This was down here, again, the data dependency,

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and since this was executed,

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the governing condition with a double quote character must have been true.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So we start with a failing assertion,

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
follow back the data dependency to out,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
follow back the control dependency to quote,

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
follow back another data dependency to quote,

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and then, finally get to the governing condition in here,

32
00:01:44,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which also is the place where the defect is.
