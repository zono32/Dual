1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The question is: Can we do such a thing automatically?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The answer is yes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We can do so using Delta Debugging.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The idea is as follows.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
At a given location we extract the state for the failing run

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
as well as for a passing run.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Then we go and compare the states.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What we then get is a set of differences

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
between states found in the passing run and states found in the failing run

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
for each single variable.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
With Delta Debugging, we can now find a minimal subset of these

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
differences that causes the passing run to fail.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This minimal subset then at the given location

14
00:00:51,000 --> 99:59:59,000
is the variable that causes the failure.
