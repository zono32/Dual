00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What we're going to discuss today is how errors propagate in a program,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
that is, from one variable to another,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
because these very dependencies then help us in reasoning backwards.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And this is our second topic:

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
how we can trace back these dependencies from an observable failure

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
to an earlier infection

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and then to a defect in the code.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And for this we're going to use the Sherlock Holmes method

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
which, of course, is: "Elementary, my dear Watson."

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But first, a quiz. Do you like Sherlock Holmes?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Here are your options.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is it more like: "I'm his greatest fan!"

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Or: "Isn't he, like, outdated?"

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Or: "Actually, I find him annoying."

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Or: "Sherlock who?"

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hint: The answer to this quiz will neither determine your grading

17
00:00:54,000 --> 99:59:59,000
nor will it determine the next step. Enjoy.
