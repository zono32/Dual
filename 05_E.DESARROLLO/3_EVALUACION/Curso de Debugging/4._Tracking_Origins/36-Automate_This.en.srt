00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
To close, we're going to use Delta Debugging

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
to do something pretty cool,

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
namely to give us a full diagnosis on what's happening

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
when the program fails.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Our diagnosis will look something like this:

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
First this variable had this value.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This caused this other variable to get this other value.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then this third variable gets set to this other value.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That is what finally made the program crash.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
In other words, what we get is cause-effect chain

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
throughout the program, which explains how the failure came to be

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
in all of this automatically.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This cause-effect chain may or may not include the infected values,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
but frequently it does.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Even if it does not, it immediately helps you understand

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
how the failure came to be.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The basic idea is as follows:

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If we can change any of these variables

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
such that the failure no longer occurs,

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
then we have found a failure cause.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How should we change a variable?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
After all, variables can take arbitrary values.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The rule is not to make them use arbitrary values

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but to use values from a successful run.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That is, during execution we change variables

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
from the values found in the failing run

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
to values found in a successful run.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If we can change a variable value such that the failure goes away,

29
00:01:18,000 --> 99:59:59,000
we do have a failure cause.
