1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let us take a look again

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
at our remove html markup function.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Here I'm going back to the earlier version,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which is sort of fixed.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now let's take a look at this condition up here.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We want to know where the core value

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
could possibly have come from

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
To do so, we follow the data dependencies.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What are the statements that this statement

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
is data dependent upon?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
To do so, we will look at the places

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
where quote would be written.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And which also would be executed

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
before this statement will be executed.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
For instance, this statement would be data

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
dependent on that earlier statement.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Because here quote is being written,

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
and here quote is being read.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Therefore, the statement A up here sets the state

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
that B later on keeps on processing.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
If you want to understand how B behaves,

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
we follow the data dependencies to A

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
and find that this is one of the statements

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
that sets the state that B depends upon.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Now for a quiz.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Which are the other statements that B data depends upon?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Is this for C in S,

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
is this elf of C equals the greater sign and not quote,

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
is this quote equals not quote,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
or is this out equals out plus C?

31
00:01:18,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Check all that apply.
