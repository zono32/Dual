1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
But there is more that we can deduce from the code.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Since the character was a less than sign,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we have a condition which specifically checks for less than signs, up here.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
However, this condition apparently had not turned out to be true.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Therefore, we can now deduce the value of the quote variable.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What was the value of the quote variable here?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Over to you.
