00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What you can see now is that, although we have formally proven that our code

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
cannot violate this assertion, there still may be other issues,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
which simply aren't properly specified yet.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So any proof can only be as good as the specification it relies on.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Which, of course, again is a call for good assertions.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Because if you do have good assertions, you get good specifications, and this

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
will not only help you a lot in debugging, you will also improve your testing,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and as we have seen, it may even enable the use of automated deduction tool.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
But now, for a programming exercise.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It really, really annoys me that this function isn't entirely done yet.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Please go take this function and fix it such that this html markup is properly removed.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I promise this will be the last time we are going to be fixing this function.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Over to you.
