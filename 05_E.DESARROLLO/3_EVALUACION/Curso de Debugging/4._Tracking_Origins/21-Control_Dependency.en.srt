1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
When we are reasoning about a program, our reasoning follows these dependencies.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In this case, if we want to know where C comes from or where quote comes from,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
we follow the dependencies to the specific locations, and we can do so again.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If we are up here, for instance,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and we want to know where C comes from, well, C comes from S,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
and S comes from up  here.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
S first goes down here, then defines C, and then C is being checked.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Likewise, if we want to know where quote comes from,

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
quote comes from this statement.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So we see again, here quote is being written, here quote is being read.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So this statement depends on itself,

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and quote, again, can either come from this location,

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
or it can come from the original assignment.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It is precisely along these relationships

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
that we structure our reasoning.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Where does this value come from, and where was it set?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If we take a look at this statement, however,

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
we will quickly find that data dependencies are not enough

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
because the value of quote in here may depend on the earlier value of quote,

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
but we also need to take into account

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
that this statement had to be executed in the first place.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In order to be executed, it depends on earlier conditions.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is the concept of control dependency.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If there is some statement which controls whether the statement B is executed or not,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
then B is being control dependent on that very statement.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In our example up here, for instance,

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the condition in A controls whether statement B is executed or not.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Therefore, B is control dependent on A.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Again, such dependencies guide our reasoning.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We find that B was executed,

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and we want to know why it was executed, after all.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
In order to figure out why it was executed,

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we follow the control dependencies.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Here is a quiz.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Which other statement does B control depend upon?

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is this for C in S?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Is this the first if statement?

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Is this the first elif statement?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Or is this the last elif statement?

40
00:02:13,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Check all that apply.
