00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
After this brief diversion, let's get back to

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
the actual deduction process.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
When you are reasoning what could have happened in a program,

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
we again see the program execution as a succession of states.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And then we reason backwards from what we

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
observe to what could have happened beforehand.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This reasoning, this backwards reasoning

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
is actually structured along the ways that earlier

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
events in the program could have influenced later events.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The most important concept when

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
reasoning backwards is called data dependency.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The idea is as follows:

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We do have 2 statements, say A and B in the program,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and now A writes a variable,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
which is later read by B.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In our example up here, A may have written this variable,

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and this will then be read by B.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then we say that these 2 statements are data dependent on each other.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
B is data dependent on A

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
because there is a flow of data

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
from the statement A to the statement B.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This concept of data dependency allows us

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
to trace back the possible locations in the state

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
as well as the statements that cause them

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
back within the program execution and therefore

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
to isolate the possible causes for an infection

27
00:01:12,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and later the failure.
