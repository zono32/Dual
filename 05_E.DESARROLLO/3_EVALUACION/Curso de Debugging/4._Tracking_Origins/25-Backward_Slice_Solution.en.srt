00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay. Lets complete this thing.  We are here in quote equals not quote.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is control dependent on this earlier statement, which again reads from C,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
that we have seen the dependencies of C before, but it also reads from tag.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So this is dependent on all the places that tag is being set, and then again this

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
is up to this one up here, and then again whether tag is being set or not, implies

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
a control dependency towards the governing conditions.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is usually more interesting in the backwards slice itself, is what

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
is not contained in the backwards slice.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That is, the statements that are not checked.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What you are seeing here is the statements that are not part of the backwards slice,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
are statements that refer to out, setting out, checking out, and returning out,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
but nothing of what happens to out actually has any effect on tag at this point.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And this is precisely what the backwards slice gives us.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It tells us if we want to know why this statement was executed.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, we know it can't depend on out, because there is no dependency of tag

16
00:01:11,000 --> 99:59:59,000
towards out in any way, or out cannot influence the value of tag in any way.
