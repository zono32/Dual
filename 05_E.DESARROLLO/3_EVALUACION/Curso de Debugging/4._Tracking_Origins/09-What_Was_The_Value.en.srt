1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, at this point, we know that the quote variable must have been set to true at some point.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Because initially it was false, but we already know that if it had stayed false,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
then the less than character would never have been added to the output.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So we now have deduce that quote must have been set,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and there is only one place in the program where quote is set, which is down here.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So we can deduce that this long condition, which checks for quote,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
must have held at some earlier point before the less than sign.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Why must it have been true at some earlier point?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, because at the moment when symbols left was the less than sign

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
then the condition did not hold

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That simply assumed it was the character right before the less than sign

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
then the variable tag had never been set to true.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It was false from the beginning and it was false till the very end.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,000
If you look at this condition, what was the value of c and again over to you.
