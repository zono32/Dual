00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's check the variables that are read by B.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is the variable C and the variable quote.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Lets first check C.  Where is C being written?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
C is being assigned here in this for statement.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Therefore, this statement indeed is what B is dependent upon.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Next one down here.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Here we have C and quote again, but they are only being read and not written.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Therefore, these do not influence the data at B.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Down here we have quote equals not quote.  This is obvious.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Quote is being set, and therefore we have a data dependency.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Finally here, we have out equals out plus C.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Here the out variable is being written, but nothing in here reads the out variable.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Therefore, there is no data dependency.
