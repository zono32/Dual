1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This last point called for a quiz.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Why is it better to have an automated test rather than a problem report?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Is it that you can always check whether the problem persists

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
by running the automated test?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Is it that you can always reproduce the problem?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If the test fails, you can start debugging right away?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Or you can query as much additional information as you need?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Check all that apply.
