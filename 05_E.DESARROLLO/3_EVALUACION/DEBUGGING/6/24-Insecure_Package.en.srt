00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What you see here is a representation of all the classes in Firefox.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Every class here in this picture is a rectangle.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The larger the rectangle, the more lines of code in that class.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
These rectangles are nested into folders and packages.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The color of the rectangle indicates how many security issues have been fixed

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
in that particular class.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What we see here, for instance, is the document object model,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
which has a fair share of security fixes.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But there is more areas with plenty of security issues.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Here we have JavaScript.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Here we do have HTML layout.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here we have a library for displaying the content.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now for the quiz.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Which of these four packages has had the most security issues in the past?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Is it JavaScript? Is it HTML layout?

16
00:01:02,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Is it the DOM? Or is the content base?
