1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It turns out that, yes, if there have been many bugs in one place,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
it is likely that there will be more bugs in the very same place.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the more interesting, because all the bugs we see have been fixed,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
so you'd assume that over time there would be fewer bugs.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But that's not the case.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
With bugs it's like fishing.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You find plenty of bugs in one place one day.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The next day fish will assemble at the same place again,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
possibly because fish like the same places again and again,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
except that for fish we have a good theory on how the reproduce.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
For bugs, we do not.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There is a bit of a hypothesis though.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The assumption is that the same factors that have contributed to bugs in the past

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
will keep on contributing in the future.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Generally speaking, past fixes and a bit less so past changes

16
00:01:03,000 --> 99:59:59,000
are good predictors for future fixes.
