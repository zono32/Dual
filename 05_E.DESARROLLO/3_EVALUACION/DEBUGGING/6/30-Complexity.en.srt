1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Next hypothesis--complexity.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Is it so that complex code has more bugs than simple code?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Can we use, say, code metrics to predict where the most bugs will be in the future?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Pick your choice.
