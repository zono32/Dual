1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer to this question is yes,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
or at least that team structure can matter.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
A very interesting study at Microsoft looked how teams that were responsible

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
for individual features were compose.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
More specifically, the study would look for how distant

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the common manager of a team was.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If there would be one direct common manager for all members of the team,

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
that distance would be 1, and if their common manager would be, say,

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
two levels removed, then the distance would be 2.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If the lowest common manager of a team would be say, Steve Ballmer,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the manager of Microsoft, then the distance would be 7 or 8 or whatever

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the number of management levels at Microsoft is.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now, it turned out that the higher this distance was the more defect prone

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
the modules produced by that team were.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The assumption is that if there is no joint management in a team

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
where every decision first has to go up to the highest level and then back again,

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
then this makes teamwork particularly hard.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It also makes it hard to make decisions,

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and it makes it hard to create some common responsibility

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
for the module you're working on.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This study was made on Windows Vista.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
As a result of that study, Microsoft reorganized the teams

23
00:01:39,000 --> 99:59:59,000
for later versions of Windows such that situations like these would no longer occur.
