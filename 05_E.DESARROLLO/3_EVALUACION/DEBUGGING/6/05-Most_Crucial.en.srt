00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now for the quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One of these 5 facts allows to infer most, if not all of the others,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and, therefore, it is the most crucial of these 5.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Which one is it?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Is it the problem history?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Diagnostic information?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The experienced behavior?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The expected behavior?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Or a one-line summary?
