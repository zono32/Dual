00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Many operating systems allow you to submit bug reports

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
more or less automatically as soon as a program crashes.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is the dialog that appears on a mac os system.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Essentially Apple asks you just one single question,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and that is again the steps necessary to reproduce the problem.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Everything else can be deduced from that one.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
On top of that the bug report also includes

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
problem details and system configuration,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
which is, for instance, the version number of the program that crashed,

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the current process, date and time,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
the functions that were active at the moment of the crash,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
as well as any hardware attached to the machine.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here are the steps needed to reproduce the problem,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and we send the whole thing to Apple.
