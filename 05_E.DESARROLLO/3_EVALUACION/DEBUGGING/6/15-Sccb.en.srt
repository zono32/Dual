00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Many organizations use a software change control board,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
or SCCB to set priorities.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is a group of people who look into the problem database

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
and take care of the handling of the problems.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Such a group typically consists of developers, testers, and managers.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What they do is the keep track of resolved and unresolved problems,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
assign a priority to individual problems,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and then assign these problems to individual developers.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
As you can see, a problem database is a very important tool

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
in the management of a product.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
All the discussion on all the features eventually is stored in here.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You can even use it as a tool for requirements management.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When the project starts you enter a single problem in here,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
which states the product is missing.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Then you add up more requirements and more requirements,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
which eventually will have to be fulfilled.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
A board like the SCCB then decides who should take care of

18
00:01:07,000 --> 99:59:59,000
which issue and when.
