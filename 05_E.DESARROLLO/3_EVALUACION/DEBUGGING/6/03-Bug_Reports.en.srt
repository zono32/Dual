00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
But being the maintainer of a popular software

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
also means you have to provide lots of support,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
which meant that I got plenty of bug reports.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
These ranged from the absurd,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
as in DDD crashed, thought you'd like to know

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to the rather questionable,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
DDD crashed on our Cray.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I have enclosed a core dump.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Please be aware we're working on super-secret data here, so don't share.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Attachment: Core dump 50 MB.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Some of them were very questionable.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
DDD hangs on my new pets@home project.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
All files are enclosed.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Attached: home directory.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The home directory here actually included passwords

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and bank account information.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So much for free software.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
On some days I could easily get

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
dozens and dozens of such bug reports.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Some with helpful information, many without.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Of course, I would have been able to ask for

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
more information on each of these,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
but then, you know, I wasn't exactly paid for the job.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Finally, I would set up DDD such that whenever it crashed,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
it would ask for vital information

26
00:01:14,000 --> 99:59:59,000
that I needed to reproduce the failure.
