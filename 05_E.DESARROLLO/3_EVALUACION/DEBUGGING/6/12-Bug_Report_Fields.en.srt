1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
How are all these problems classified?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Let's look on advanced search to see what the individual attibutes

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
of a bug report are.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Up here you can see the status of the problem.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Is it a new problem or is it a resolved problem?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If it's a resolved problem, you can look up the resolution here.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Was it fixed, or is it something that won't be fixed?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Further down you can see the version

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
of Mozilla that is affected by the problem

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
as well as the severity and the priority of the problem.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What do these fields mean?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's look at them in detail.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, what are all these fields?

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
First there's severity, which describes the impact of the problem on the user.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The most severe problems are classified as blockers or show stoppers.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
These are problems that effectively halt all further development.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then the are critical problems, major problems, minor problems,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
down to enhancement requests.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Enhancement requests are issues a user

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
would like to see in some future version.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
They are also stored in the problem database.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's say that other problems are more severe at this point.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Priority defines how soon the problem will be addressed.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The problems with the highest priority will be addressed first.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Problems with lower priority will be addressed later.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Bug ID is a unique identifier or number,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
which allows you to precisely identify a single problem.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Comments are left by developers

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
adding additional information about the bug

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
or proposing fixes on how to address the bug.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Finally notification.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
These are the stakeholders.

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Whoever is listed here will be notified automatically

34
00:01:55,000 --> 99:59:59,000
whenever a problem gets a new status.
