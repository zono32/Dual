1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, the answer is complexity matters sometimes.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Sometimes in the project there is a correlation

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
between some complexity metric and the real number of bugs.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But very frequently there isn't.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Then in every project there is some other complexity metric

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that correlates, so it might just as well be random.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 99:59:59,000
So, no. Complexity is not related to bugs as found in production code.
