1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The answer to that question is no.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Actually, the opposite is true.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The more thoroughly a piece of code is tested,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
the more bugs it is likely to have.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The story goes the other way around.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Good managers have a good intuition of where the bugs are,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and then when deciding on where and how to test

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
they go for the locations where most bugs would be suspected.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Therefore, in a program like Firefox for instance,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
there is lots and lots of testing that's being done for JavaScript, for instance.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Therefore, this has high coverage,

12
00:00:42,000 --> 99:59:59,000
but still many, many bugs are left because testing apparently can't find all the bugs.
