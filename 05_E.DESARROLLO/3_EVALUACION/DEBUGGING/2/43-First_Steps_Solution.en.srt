00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Here comes the answer. Well, that actually was a rather boring quiz.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Of course data invariants, if it's large data structures, cover much of the space.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
If these are data structures that are frequently used,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
they're frequently checked with every single use.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Data invariants make up an important part of all sorts of pre- and postconditions.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 99:59:59,000
Finally, the assertions you write down here provide helpful documentation for programmers.
