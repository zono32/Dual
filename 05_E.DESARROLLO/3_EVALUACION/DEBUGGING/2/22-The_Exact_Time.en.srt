1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
And again, if you think of a program as a succession of states that passing assertion

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
can immediately tell you that there is large parts of the state

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
where the infection cannot have taken place.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If these were the time object in your state, you would know that all of them have correct values

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
because none of their assertions has failed.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One problem, however, remains without time class.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You can still pass floating point numbers as arguments here

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and then get an error while we're trying to print the time.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So here is your programming exercise, extend the code such that all parameters up here

10
00:00:36,000 --> 99:59:59,000
are automatically converted into integers.
