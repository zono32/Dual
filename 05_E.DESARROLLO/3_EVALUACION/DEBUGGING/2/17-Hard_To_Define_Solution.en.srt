1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
And now for the answer to our quiz.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Generally, anything you can measure can also be turned into post condition,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and if at some physical condition, then it's typically very easy.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The audio level must not exceed 80 db.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
While assuming we have a way to measure the audio level, which any descent

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
audio software should have, yup--this is easy to turn into a post condition.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Turn this into a post condition and you will save millions and millions of ears from damage.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Next thing, the animated catch should walk like a real cat. Ah, real cat.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
If there ever is a specification of what makes a cat a real cat,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I would be very, very delighted to see that.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm pretty sure cats know precisely what to do and what not to do.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
For everybody else, that remain a mystery.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Under specific atmospheric condition, the sunset simulation shall produce a green flash.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Lo and behold, that's what a PHD student at my department did.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He was specializing in computer graphics and his PHD thesis was perfect sunset simulation,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and indeed, in reality under specific conditions,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
you can have a green flash during a sunset for just a second.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I think this has been witnessed by only a few hundred people

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and only banned on film twice so far,

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and well having green or some amount of green in an image--it's actually pretty easy to check.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So I am pretty sure he also had a post condition that were done and show that he was successful,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and finally response time shall be below 10 ms.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's straightforward. Time is something that's easy to measure.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 99:59:59,000
This can also become a simple post condition.
