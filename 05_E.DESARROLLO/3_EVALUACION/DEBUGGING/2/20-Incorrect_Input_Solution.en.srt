1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We can find the answer to this question right within our environment.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We first just run the initialization--that is just passing a string in here and we just run

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and nothing happens, no error message, so this is just fine.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's actually possible to pass a string object here.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Now, when we try to print it out and run this whole thing, we get an error message

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
because now what we have is that the format up here is no longer appropriate

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
for an object of type string--that is Python does not know how to format a string

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
with two digits with a leading zero.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As you see, as soon as we are printing out the object, we get an error

10
00:00:35,000 --> 99:59:59,000
and therefore, the correct answer here is we get an error while printing.
